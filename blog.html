    <h3>a webdesign bootcamp designed by me<h2>
    <p>This bootcamp teaches me to a career level coding in front end webdevelopment, and webdesign, I'm happy for this bootcamp.</p>
    <h3>DAY 1</h3>
        <p>The first season started today. The course will be four months long. This is what I wrote earlier today, as a quick outline for the first day's plan: On this bootcamp we are learning accelerated learning through a Coursera course. Essential reading is Tao Te King by Lao Tze, Jatek a Vegtelennel by Rozsa Peter. Today we are starting with starting a course on coursera to learn faster. It lasts approxmiately 1 month. Then we will play Brilliant to get into, refresh the fundamentals of useful disciplines like maths, physics, computer science, neuroscience etc. Then we will draw and practice visual notes taking. We will work on our sketchbooks, research websites and design the works, look into their makings, and see what we can take away and take further from those ideas. We will continue recollecting useful material from past courses, methods, ideas, stuf that worked. We will continue with our Arduino projects. We will foto read code, manuals. Will have thought about how to integrate musical learning and martial arts into code and design learning and vice versa. At the end of our productive day there will be an hour or so restorative yoga and tai chi session to refresh ourselves. We will kickstart our portfolio and blog. We will continue with the Front End Masters bootcamp and every 15 min or so we practice mental play, and feel free to stand up, go about, take breaks, move your body, breathe etc </p>

        <p>at the end of the first day, looking back, this is what worked: 
            - <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/home/week/1">the coursera course is fantastic Learning How to Learn</a> follows on from the Fundamentals of Piano Practice book, <br>
