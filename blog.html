    <p>It is March 17th 2021. I started to learn coding again in November. We learnt Pascal language back in high school and I failed a year and had to learn the language so I could pass. This was many years ago. I'm learning JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I did the FrontEndMasters free bootcamp and I am now doing freecodecamp. Not sure how to go about this technical blog, but got the suggestion to make one. Yesterday I learnt about destructuring syntax in ES6. I take visual notes in a sketchbook. I am reading Regular Expressions by Jeffrey Friedl and Don't Make Me Think. I got to about page 80 something in the regex book and started to read it again, I am learning the basics, quantors for example, which are ? + and *. Then there are () for grouping things and \(\) to exit brackets so that a bracket with backslash become literal characters from metacharacter. Metacharacters are . - * ? [] () ^ etc. like grammar in spoken languages while literal characters are words.
