                It is March 17th 2021. I started to learn coding again in November. We learnt Pascal language back in high school and I failed a year and had to learn the language so I could pass. This was many years ago. I'm learning JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I did the FrontEndMasters free bootcamp and I am now doing freecodecamp. Not sure how to go about this technical blog, but got the suggestion to make one. Yesterday I learnt about destructuring syntax in ES6. I take visual notes in a sketchbook. I am reading Regular Expressions by Jeffrey Friedl and Don't Make Me Think. I got to about page 80 something in the regex book and started to read it again, I am learning the basics, quantors for example, which are ? + and *. Then there are () for grouping things and \(\) to exit brackets so that a bracket with backslash become literal characters from metacharacter. Metacharacters are . - * ? [] () ^ etc. like grammar in spoken languages while literal characters are words.

                I am reading Introduction to Algorithms, Regular Expressions. Yesterday I have done 15-25 min pomodoros and were quite productive. (?:….) Found a regular expressions puzzle for iPhone, great idea, it only had ten games. It would be cool to have one with many many games and levels. I might be able to create one. I can start an open source regular expressions game project. (?=…) This is a positive lookahead. \x is a flag for multiline mode in Perl regular expressions. There are object oriented and procedural programming languages. There is awk, sed, Tcl, C#, VB.NET, Java, Ruby, Python. It is possible to work with Unicode in regular expressions \p{Unicode name} is an example. Then there is \P{Unicode name}. Git can be used in the command line. One can use commands to navigate with git. ls directory name is an example. Readability of code is important. Writing code that humans can read. Environmental impact of using images, videos, emails. Practicing for process. Climbing I find new routes. Formatting the technical blog.
